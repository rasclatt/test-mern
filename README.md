# Tech Assessment Challenge

After downloading the repository, make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.

In the main project directory, use the command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Docker should build the project and install the container for use. After the application is complete, you should be able to access the site on your localhost on port `3000` like so:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

The project runs a React instance with ViteJS as the bundler. I have found vitejs to be very reliable and predictibable for ReactJS which is why I have used it here. Below are the assets in this project.

The project runs a mongo db and Express server on their respective ports.

This project is relatively boring in terms of overall features but demonstrates REST and Frontend compidency.
